## Frontend Technologies

- React
- Styled-component
- Redux

## Backend Technologies

- for users login used
  [already existed template API](https://connections-api.herokuapp.com/docs/)
- for deals created
  [own API with MySQL data base](https://github.com/hsvietik/skyscraper-test-backend).
  Unfortunately for now it runs only locally on the port 3001, couldn't manage
